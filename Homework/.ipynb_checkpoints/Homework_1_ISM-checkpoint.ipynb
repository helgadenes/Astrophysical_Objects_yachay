In particular astroquery has problems with some versions of astropy. This is a combination of the two packages that should work together:\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem analyses the properties of a neutral hydrogen (HI) cloud in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The data was taken with the ASKAP telescope and is a subset of the data presented in Pingel et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1017/pasa.2021.59).\n",

    "1. Read in the data from the \"cloud_sub_cube.fits\" file (In the Homework/data directory). What are the dimensions of the data cube?\n",
    "2. Make a declination vs. velocity plot. How many distinct features can you see in the plot? \n",
    "3. Make a spectrum of the whole cube (velocity vs intensity summed for all spatial pixels). Can you identify the same features (lines) as in the declination vs. velocity plot? Do you see any differences? \n",
    "4. Make a moment 0 map (inegrated intensity map) of the following velocity range: 96 - 113 km/s. \n",
    "- For this, make an array of the relevant velocity range by calculating the values for the velocity axis in km/s. \n",
    "- Use numpy.where() to find the indecies for the relevant velocity range, \n",
    "- then use indecies to select the relevant part of the data cube. \n",

    "\n",
    "6. Based on the $\\chi^2$ map, did the decomposition perform well? How many components did Gausspy find on average?\n",
    "7. Make histograms of the decomposition results for $v_{LSR}$ , FWHM (full width at half max), and amplitude. What can you conclude about the structure of the interstellar gas based on the histograms?\n",
    "8. Make a scatter plot of v_{LSR} vs. FWHM. How many distinct features do you see? \n",
    "9. Make a map of the Gaussian components with $ 96 < v_{LSR} < 113$ km/s.\n",
    "10. Make a plot of the spectrum with the Gaussian components for the following pixels: x: 110, y:100; x:55, y:50; x:160, y:160. Does the spectra show the same features at these 3 different positions?\n"

    "## 2. (6 points) Comparing Dust maps to atomic hydrogen column density\n",

    "The aim of this problem is to compare the interstellar dust extinction to the neutral hydrogen column density of the same region in the sky.\n",

    "1. Make a map of dust extinction ($A_v$) using the dustmaps python package (https://dustmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the following region: R.A: 73.0$^{\\circ}$ Dec: 3.0$^{\\circ}$. Select the region so that it has a width of 10$^{\\circ}$ x 10$^{\\circ}$. Use data from the \"Bayestar\" dust map (Green et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5362). \n",
    "2. Get the neutral atomic hydrogen column density N(HI) map for the same region of the sky. For this you can use the astroquery python package and select the 'HI4PI' survey. Make sure to select the same region with the same pixel size. \n",
    "3. Make an overlay of the two data sets. Plot N(HI) as the contours. \n",
    "4. Make a histogram of $A_v$ and N(HI). Compare the two distributions. What do you notice about the two distributions?\n",
    "5. Make a plot of $A_v$ vs. N(HI). Fit a linear relation to the data. How does the fit compare to the relation found in Güver and Özel 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15598.x): N(HI) = $A_v \\times 2.2 \\times 10^{21}$?\n",
