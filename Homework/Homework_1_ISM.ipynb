    "This problem analyses the properties of a neutral hydrogen (HI) cloud in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The data was taken with the ASKAP telescope and is a subset of the data presented in Pingel et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1017/pasa.2021.59).\n",

    "1. Read in the data from the \"cloud_sub_cube.fits\" file (In the Homework/data directory). What are the dimensions of the data cube?\n",
    "2. Make a declination vs. velocity plot. How many distinct features can you see in the plot? \n",
    "3. Make a spectrum of the whole cube (velocity vs intensity summed for all spatial pixels). Can you identify the same features (lines) as in the declination vs. velocity plot? Do you see any differences? \n",
    "4. Make a moment 0 map (inegrated intensity map) of the following velocity range: 96 - 113 km/s. \n",
    "- For this, make an array of the relevant velocity range by calculating the values for the velocity axis in km/s. \n",

    "9. Make a map of the Gaussian components with $ 96 < v_{LSR} < 113$ km/s.\n",
    "10. Make a plot of the spectrum with the Gaussian components for the following pixels: x: 110, y:100; x:55, y:50; x:160, y:160. Does the spectra show the same features at these 3 different positions?\n"

Select the region so that it has a width of 10$^{\\circ}$ x 10$^{\\circ}$. Use data from the \"Bayestar\" dust map (Green et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5362). \n",
    "2. Get the neutral atomic hydrogen column density N(HI) map for the same region of the sky. For this you can use the astroquery python package and select the 'HI4PI' survey. Make sure to select the same region with the same pixel size. \n",
    "3. Make an overlay of the two data sets. Plot N(HI) as the contours. \n",
    "4. Make histograms of $A_v$ and N(HI). Compare the two distributions. What do you notice about the two distributions?\n",
    "5. Make a plot of $A_v$ vs. N(HI). Fit a linear relation to the data. How does the fit compare to the relation found in Güver and Özel 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15598.x): N(HI) = $A_v \\times 2.2 \\times 10^{21}$?\n",
